•Prior to building dashboard i have done:
1)Data Cleaning-It includes cleaning of data by removing duplicate values,finding out the missing values,removing blankspaces etc.
2)Data Preprocessing and Data transformation-It includes preprocessing and transforming data by adding new columns to get meaningful and important information.
3)Transformed the sales amount into Indian currency from US dollars with the help of DAX and Formula
4)Creating KPI's(Key Performance Indicators) which shows valuable insights of the sale
5) Year-Over-Year Analysis is being done on the data and KPI's
7)Creating different charts like donut chart,bar graph,area chart etc which gives meaning and important insights of the sales data.
